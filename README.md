Generation UK&amp;I Data Engineering training program practice project

# Background information

A client launched a pop-up cafe and required a software application which helps them to log and track orders.

The cafe then grew and expanded to hundreds of outlets across the country. In order to help the client increase their ability to identify company-wide trends and insights, they required a fully scalable ETL (Extract, Tranform, Load) pipeline to collect all the transaction data generated by each individual caf√© and place it in a single location so that the company's data as a whole can be queried easily.

# Project structure

This project has 2 main components:
- Orders_tracking_app_local: The software application that helps the client to log and track orders using CLI command
- ETL: The ETL pipeline
